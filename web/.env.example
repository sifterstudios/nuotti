# Nuotti Web (SvelteKit) environment example
# Copy to ".env" for local builds, or provide these as build-time envs in CI.
# Note: This app is built as a static site (adapter-static) and served by nginx.
# Only build-time variables are used; runtime container env does not affect the already-built files.

# Base URL for the Backend API that the web client should call.
# This is injected at build time via Vite define (__PUBLIC_API_BASE__).
# Example for local dev API:
PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:5240

# Optional base path (useful if the site is hosted under a subpath), e.g. "/web".
# SvelteKit reads this at build time through svelte.config.js (paths.base).
# Leave empty for root deployment.
